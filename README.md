# effect-ts-tree

An generic eager N-Ary tree datatype that does:

1. Stack-safe folds and unfolds via [effect-ts-folds]().
2. Instances for [@effect/typeclass](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect).
3. Encoders/decoders for arrays, edge lists, path lists, indented string, and Preyer codes.
4. File system trees: read/write folders recursively.
5. An enumerator that lets you test _all_ possible trees below a node count.
6. An arbitrary for [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check).
