## Synopsis

```ts
import {from, of, drawTree} from 'effect-tree'

console.log(
  drawTree.doubleSpaceThin(
    from('Hello', from('World', of('ðŸŒ³')))
  )
)
```

Prints:

```txt
â”€â”¬Hello
 â”‚
 â””â”€â”¬World
   â”‚
   â””â”€â”€ðŸŒ³
```

## About

1. The basic immutable generic data structure for encoding _generic eager trees_ with 0-n child nodes per branch, also called [Rose Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_tree) and everything you need to efficiently query and operate on them.
1. Stack-safe [folds](src/folds.ts)/[unfolds](src/unfolds.ts), and a [library of operations](src/ops.ts) on trees, from [counting](src/ops/counts.ts) to [zipping](src/ops/zip.ts).
1. [Encode/decode trees](src/codec.ts) into indented strings Ã  la YAML, nested arrays, edge lists, path lists, and [PrÃ¼fer codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%BCfer_sequence).
1. Instances for [@effect/typeclass](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/typeclass/README.md) with [law tests](src/instances/laws.test.ts).
1. [Draw themeable trees](src/draw/tree.test.ts) on the terminal with support for multiline labels.
1. Testing helpers: Customizable [arbitraries](src/arbitrary/Tree/options.ts) and functions to [enumerate labeled trees](src/codec/prufer/enumerate.ts).

You can find [API documentation here](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs).

Read [here for more info](https://github.com/middle-ages/effect-tree/blob/main/docs/features.md) on features.

## Quick Start

* Install

```sh
pnpm install effect-tree
```

* Import

Everything can be imported from the top level entry-point.

```ts
import {leaf, type Tree} from 'effect-tree

const myLeaf: Tree<string> = leaf('hello')
```

* Create

You can create leaves and branches with the functions [leaf]() and [branch]()

```ts
import {Tree, branch, leaf} from 'effect-tree

const myBranch: Tree<string> = branch(
  'root branch', [
    leaf('hello'),
    leaf('world'),
  ]
)
```

Other ways to create trees:

1. **Building from code** Functions like [tree](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/functions/index.tree.html), [branch](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/functions/index.tree.html), [from](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/functions/index.tree.html), [of](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/functions/index.tree.html) (and alias for [leaf](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/functions/index.tree.html)), [withForest](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/functions/index.tree.html) are versions of the basic [branch](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/functions/index.branch.html) and [leaf](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/functions/index.branch.html) functions, specialized for composing tree building pipelines.
1. **Decoding from data** Decode trees from common encodings: [edge lists](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/), [nested arrays](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/), [indented strings](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/), [PrÃ¼fer codes](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/), and a [list of tree paths](https://middle-ages.github.io/effect-tree-docs/).

1. **Unfold with unfolding functions** . Functions like [unfoldLevelTree](src/ops/levels.ts#L158) unfold trees using functions for [unfolding a single level of tree](src/unfolds.ts).

* Draw

```ts
import {Tree, binaryTree, drawTree, map} from 'effect-tree'
import {pipe} from 'effect'

console.log(
  pipe(
    3,
    binaryTree,
    map(s => s.toString()),
    drawTree,
  )
)
//â”¬1
//â”œâ”¬2
//â”‚â”œâ”€3
//â”‚â””â”€3
//â””â”¬2
// â”œâ”€3
// â””â”€3
```
